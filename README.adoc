This repository contains my solutions to the annual {aoc-website}[Advent of Code] puzzles.

Each puzzle is located in a file named in the format `[year]/[day].zig`.
Each puzzle's input is expected to be in the corresponding file `[year]/[day].txt`.

Use `./paste <day> [year]` to create `[year]/[day].zig` and paste your clipboard into `[year]/[day].txt`.
If `./paste` is symlinked to `./edit`, it will also open your editor to the respective file.
